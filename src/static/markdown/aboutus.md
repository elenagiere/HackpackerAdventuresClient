Hello, beautiful people!  My name is Luke and this is my incredible girlfriend, Elena!  Together, we are travelling the world for a year, mainly going through Latin America and East Africa.  We are your typical goofball nerds who enjoy travel, the great outdoors, deep conversation, and even deeper laughter.

This trip has been several years in the making and we are excited to finally be on this unbelievable journey across this amazing planet.  Living in California for the last 5 years, we got to experience epic hiking and camping as well as international travel to many amazing countries.  However, we felt that we needed to take some time off from work to truly itch the travel bug. This brought us to where we are now.

Throughout our travels, we plan to bring you some of our highlights through posts, pictures, videos, and smells!  (Ok, our socks are getting a lot of use, so we’ll leave the smells out). ;) We’ll also touch on how we track our expenses and what we do to maintain routine, balance, health, and fitness in a world where we’re always moving.

We hope you enjoy following our adventures as much as we will enjoy living them! <3
