After travelling for a month in Mexico, we were sure that Mexico would be our favorite Central American  country.  But somehow, some way, our time in Guatemala really gave Mexico a run for its money.   ![](guatemala/bus_opt.jpg "Bus Rides") Guatemala had a bit of everything that we tend to crave while traveling: fun adventures, temperate weather, kind people, great food, and economic accommodations.

The one negative thing that we noticed and also heard from other travelers about Guatemala can be told in one word: buses.  Before we entered Guatemala, many backpackers had told us that for whatever reason, Guatemala seemed to have some of the worst and most crammed buses of anywhere in Latin America.  We didn’t think much of it until we crossed the border into Guatemala.  We dove right into the deep end by taking a collectivo from the Belize border to a town in the north called Flores.  And I must say, I was both shocked and impressed.  Every time the driver would stop, somehow we figured out a way to fit another passenger into the limited number of seats.  Sometimes that meant people would stand or little kids would double up sitting on their mothers’ laps.  Needless to say, this situation of overpacked buses and less than ideal seats for long bus journeys was a theme throughout our time in country.  Even on tourist shuttles or 10 hour bus rides, this seemed to be the norm.  That being said, Elena and I are pretty good with occupying our thoughts and attention on the long journeys, so the buses eventually became more normal and didn’t bother us at all. ![](guatemala/tikal_opt.jpg "Tikal")

While Flores itself doesn’t have much in terms of excitement or city life, it is definitely the main jumping off point for visiting the infamous Mayan ruins of Tikal.  Even though we have seen so many  ruins in Mexico and Belize, Tikal still was stunning.  With several pyramids and a guide to explain all of the history, it was truly an amazing tour of the ancient city.

As Elena and I are traveling, we are realizing that we really love any excuse to experience the mountains, waterfalls, swimming holes, cliff jumping and anything related to those.  So, going from Flores to the beautiful Semuc Champey was a must stop on our journey continuing down south.  Semuc Champey is a very interesting natural phenomenon of stepped pools of aquamarine-colored water with a  river flowing underneath it.  It is such a unique and beautiful place that the government decided to make it a natural monument.  The place is truly a water-lover’s paradise.  Tubing down the rivers,  seeing bat caves, jumping off of waterfalls, butt sliding down natural waterslides, and exploring underwater caves are just a few of the many cool explorations.  At one point, each person in our group was given a candle and we were taken to a river that led to a cave.  We walked by candlelight, climbing up underground waterfalls and wading through neck high water. ![](guatemala/river_opt.jpg "Semuc Champey")  There was even a waterfall you could jump off of within the depths of the cave into a pool within the cave.  And there was a unique shoot where you just trust and jump into the rushing water.  I was the lucky one pushed to go first.  I called it the trust and flush, much like an early morning bowel movement.  You end up on the other end feeling fresh with the adrenaline pumping.  You can’t make this stuff up.  It is truly a water-lover’s paradise.  

While the water and rivers were relaxing, it was time to keep moving to one of my all-time favorite cities: Antigua, Guatemala.  Antigua has clearly been gringo-fied a bit with numerous Western  restaurants including foods like curries, falafel, BBQ, and salads, but they also had our favorite Al Pastor tacos which we were missing from our Mexico days.  While the food was delicious, we really came to the southern end of Guatemala to do what most travelers are here for: to see some LAVA!  ![](guatemala/tubeDance_opt.jpg "tubing dance party")

The most popular hike that most people opt to do is to hike Acatenango Volcano where you get views of the exploding Fuego Volcano.  Many people who had already hiked this volcano told us it was one of the hardest hikes they have ever done.  Being relatively experienced and thorough hikers in California, we knew to take this with a grain of salt.  We thought that the hike might be a bit strenuous, but couldn’t be that bad.  But we were wrong.  We didn’t realize, but our mountain legs have left us a bit after three months of walking on relatively flat ground in cities.  Like most volcano hikes, Acatenango had two directions: straight up to the top, and straight back down to the bottom.  It did not offer  that much in terms of rolling hills or flat stretches.  That being said, the hike didn’t take that long and was absolutely worth every step.  After sunset, seeing lava explode from the top of Fuego could be watched for hours.  It must be 100 times better than any fireworks show I have ever seen.  The raw power and sheer beauty of these explosions really can’t be put into words.  Just. Stunning. ![](guatemala/fuegoHike_opt.jpg "Volcan de Fuego")

Hanging out with our group around the campfire and cooking dinner while hearing and watching these explosions was a great bonding time.  And it reminded me of all the great hikes and backpacking trips that I have done with my California friends over the last five years.  Being out in nature, under the stars, and breathing the cool fresh air is and always will be one of my favorite places to be.

With tired legs and comfy beds in our tents, most opted for an early to bed attitude in order to prepare for the early morning sunrise hike to the summit of Acatenango.  The sunrise hike did not disappoint.  Getting to see a few more explosions from Fuego while the sun slowly took over the skyline  was a beautiful sight.  Seeing a few volcano peaks poke through the clouds down below was spectacular.  The views and the feelings were definitely some of the best of our Central America trip so far.

All good hikes must eventually come to an end.  Unfortunately, heading down this volcano probably made my legs even more sore than the uphill due to the steepness of the grade and the constant braking.  But eventually, we made it back down to civilization and enjoyed a hostel where our friend was a bartender and served us drinks while our legs rested in the most relaxing of hot tubs. ![](guatemala/fuego_opt.jpg "Volcan de Fuego")

The next day, we headed to the famous Lake Atitlán.  A beautiful lake situated just a few hours from Antigua.  The lake itself is stunning and rivals any beautiful lake in the United States.  I would say it is comparable to Lake Tahoe in terms of beauty and surrounding mountains.  It just doesn’t have any of the snow or freezing cold water like Tahoe.  The lake also has no mosquitos and seems to be a hidden gem in terms of what it offers.  What also makes the lake unique are the numerous towns and villages located along the lake’s edge.  Some towns are locals towns where they make traditional Guatemalan clothing.  Some are known for their chocolate or cacao tours.  Some towns are where the expats live.  Some have the late night parties.  And some are known more for their hippies and yoga retreats.  There seems to be a town or village for everyone here.  And there are no shortages of water taxis and boats to help you explore all of them.

We had a great few days exploring all of these places, doing more sunrise hikes, and touring many local  areas.  We had the best burger we have had while travelling outside the US so far at a place called No Hay Deer in San Pedro.  And we also had maybe the best barbecue I’ve ever had which is put on by a ![](guatemala/frappeLake_opt.jpg "Lake Atitlán") couple from South Carolina who now lives at Lake Atitlán.  The barbecue is only done once a week on Sundays from noon till 4 pm.  But it is one of the biggest events every week.  It looks like they may have taken a page from Tim Ferris’s The 4-Hour Workweek.

Despite our several amazing stops in Guatemala, we knew we had to keep moving and heading south.  Next, we will spend a few days relaxing on the beach and practicing our surfing skills in the small and sometimes overlooked country of El Salvador.


#### Money Saving Tips Used This Trip:

* Shop around for the best prices for the Acatenango hike through word of mouth and asking other travelers/backpackers.
* Go to a thrift store in Guatemala if you need new clothes.  I got a new hat for 33 cents.
