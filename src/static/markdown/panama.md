Honestly, we didn’t have too high of expectations for Panama. We didn’t think it would be much different than Costa Rica and we were told that prices were just as high/expensive here compared to Costa Rica.  Much to our surprise, the ![](panama/sanBlasUs_opt.jpg "San Blas")nature and wildlife in Panama was amazing in so many ways.  We started in the northwest on the islands of Bocas Del Toro.  One of the most famous places in the country to visit, these islands seemed to have it all: gorgeous beaches, wildlife, and huge surfable waves for the Carribean Sea.

We started with an all day boat tour, getting to see dolphins, sleepy sloths, so many starfish, and gorgeous beaches with huge and powerful waves.  Sloths are one of the animals that I really wanted to see in Central America.  We missed our opportunities to see them in Nicaragua and Costa Rica, so I was very glad to see them climbing and sleeping in Panama.  And seeing sloths right alongside dolphins was a pretty special experience to see so much wildlife so close together.  One of the islands that we visited had an amazing peninsula with beautiful waters where you could get waves to crash into you from both directions. Very powerful but very pretty scenery.  

The next day, we visited Reg Frog beach, an area known to have the most beautiful, vibrant, tiny little red frogs.  We ended up frog searching for a few hours and found quite a few of these pretty creatures hopping around.![](panama/redFrog_opt.jpg "Red Frog Beach")  Much to our joy, on our way back to our water taxi, we also found a sloth moving from treetop to treetop in the canopy of the forest.  We watched him in awe for about half an hour as his slow yet meticulous moves made him look like a graceful rock climber, careful with each hold and every movement.

From Bocas, we took a night bus to Panama City to help be more efficient with the 10 hour journey.  When we arrived in Panama City, we were in absolute shock and awe.  Panama City was HUGE.  It was a proper city with skyscrapers, modern restaurants, and Uber availability.  It felt like we were back in Mexico City in many ways.  We hadn’t seen a “big” city throughout all of the smaller Central American countries.  So, the fact that Panama City was ![](panama/bikePanama_opt.jpg "Panama Bike Ride") actually quite a big city completely took us by surprise.

We started our morning with a 4 hour bike ride tour of the different areas and neighborhoods.  It was a perfect way to hear about some of the history and get some background on what to do with our days in the capital.![](panama/panamaCity_opt.jpg "Panama City")

Of course, the biggest must-see site in all of Panama must be the famous Panama Canal.  If you are as nerdy as me or if you just enjoy seeing big things move, then this is absolutely a must-see and truly remarkable experience.  You can get to the famous Miraflores locks (the compartmentalized bodies of water that add and subtract water to help ships pass through the canal) by only a 15 minute drive from the city.  You can start with a walkthrough of their museum learning about the history, how it was built, how it works, who passes through, and much more. Then, you can go up to the fourth floor and actually watch the boats as they move through the locks.  It is the only canal and only time in the world that the ship captain must give up control of his ship to specialized Panama Canal engineers who oversee the whole process of getting the ships through.  People literally get a college degree in “Panama Canal Engineering” for lack of a better word.  It must be one of the most specialized degrees in the world.  ![](panama/panamaCanal_opt.jpg "Panama Canal") Watching the ships pass through is an absolutely mesmerizing experience.

We ended our day at one of the skyscrapers in the heart of downtown Panama City.  Formerly Trump Tower, this place was known to have one of the best views of sunset in the city.  It did not disappoint.

For those who aren’t aware, there is a section of land that connects Panama and Colombia that is known as the Darien Gap that is largely untouched by modern society.  This area is one of the least visited places on the planet, full of indigenous people, exotic plants, and - most notably - its dangerous paramilitary groups.  There are no roads through the Darien Gap and you can’t drive between these two countries.  Therefore, to go from Panama to Colombia, you have two options: fly or sail.

![](panama/sanBlasSail_opt.jpg "Santana Catamaran")Knowing how unique of an opportunity this was, we chose to sail.  The sailing portion included parts of open water, but also through the beautiful tiny San Blas islands where indigenous Kunu people lived.  Sailing was a fairly new thing for us.  We’ve done a 3 day trip on a friend’s sailboat once or twice.  But this was a commitment of 6 days and 5 nights on a catamaran sailboat partially sailing through open water on the ocean.  We weren’t quite sure what we were getting ourselves into, but that is part of the adventure of our year of travel.  It was also another way that we knew we could push ourselves outside of our comfort zones to try something new and see how it goes.

We showed up in a small fishing village in northern Panama called Puerto Lindo from where our catamaran would leave.  We got to meet our captain, crew and fellow passengers at a nice restaurant on land before we commit to our sea legs for a week.  We were a team of one captain, two crewmembers, and 14 passengers.

Six of the passengers on our boat had a particularly interesting story.  They were a married couple from Germany with their four children from ages 16 to 9.  This family has been traveling and living in various corners of the world on and off for decades.  Currently, they are on a trip from Canada down through the tip of South America.  They homeschool their kids for most of the year.![](panama/sanBlasIsland_opt.jpg "San Blas Island")  Every now and again, they will stay in one location for several months so that the kids can have an actual school for a semester before they head on and continue travelling.  They have a medium-sized off-road campervan that can traverse over sand and rough terrain.  So, no corner of the earth is left undiscovered.  What a crazy life they have.  I couldn’t stop asking them questions throughout our 6 days together.

To get started, we got a full tour of the boat, a thorough safety demonstration, an explanation of customs and passport control, and a rundown of what to expect from our sailing trip.  From there, the crew got the boat ready and we left the marina ready to sail through the night and get to our first island in San Blas.

The night was certainly a little rough for most of us on the boat.  People didn’t have their sea legs under them yet, so the rocking and crashing of waves as we travelled to our first island was new to most people.  A few on the boat were smart enough to take seasickness medication before heading to bed.  But not everyone had that luxury.

We woke up and the waves were calm and the anchor was down.  We made it to our first stop in San Blas and had much calmer waters.  I remember waking up and coming up out of the ship to see these absolutely stunning waters and incredible beaches.  These islands must be the prettiest beaches and water I have ever been blessed enough ![](panama/sanBlasLuke_opt.jpg "Chilling on a beach")to witness.

Spending three different days on various islands was such a treat.  Having complete isolation from cell phone signal or Wi-Fi was also a nice break from the outside world.  It was also remarkable to see how the indigenous Kunu people lived on these isolated islands.  Paddling in dug out canoes from one island to the next was remarkable to watch.  

One night, we spent some time with the locals and had a huge bonfire while drinking coconut rum out of actual coconuts that the locals gathered for us.  Then, we played duck duck goose with the local indigenous kids as well as the young German children.  Seeing how games and laughter can join these poor local children with these relatively privileged German kids was such a juxtaposing and humbling experience.  That will be a night I will never forget.

While I could go on and on about the dolphins we saw swimming alongside our boat, or the hundreds of starfish we saw, or the islands that Elena and I would literally have all to ourselves for a few hours, I will say that the ![](panama/boatDinner_opt.jpg "our boat family")best part was bonding with everyone on our boat and getting to hear everyone’s stories for 6 days.  When you don’t have internet or phones to distract you, it is amazing how much you can learn through conversation with others face to face.

Well, eventually, we made it through the islands and across the open water of the ocean to Cartagena, Colombia!  While we had a great time with our new friends for a few days on the water, we were happy to see land and officially be in South America for the first time on our trip!


#### Money Saving Tips Used This Trip:

* Taxes are low in Panama.  Some things are very cheap.  Alcohol and clothing is very cheap and there are a surprising number of worldwide brands you can find here.  I think it is due to so much trade happening through the Panama Canal.
* They have all the brands in the world passing through their country, so it would be easy to drop off a shipping container or two.
* Do your research on what buses and taxis should cost.  They tried to rip us off in Panama more than any other Central American country.
* Night buses will help you save on a night’s worth of accommodation.
