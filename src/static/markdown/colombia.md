![](colombia/tayrona_opt.jpg "tayrona national park")It took us a few days to get our land legs under us after being on a boat for a few days.  But what a great place to get to explore.  We landed in Cartagena but immediately took a bus to Santa Marta, wanting to get to see the incredible Tayrona National Park before it closed for the month of February for repair as well as indigenous rituals.

Santa Marta was a quiet but nice little city with a beautiful waterfront to watch the sunset.  But most people come to Santa Marta as the jumping off point to see the outdoors and natural areas surrounding the northern coast of Colombia.  With dunes, beaches, and beautiful waters, you feel like you’re still in the Carribean.  

While you can camp and sleep in hammocks at Tayrona National Park, we decided to do it in a long day trip.  We woke up at 5:00 am to catch the bus to the park.  We got to do lots of hiking under the canopy of the tall jungle trees most of the way.  We saw incredible beaches and made it to the quintessential point with two stunning beaches, rocks to jump off of, and viewpoints of Colombia’s beauty.  This is truly a must-see place if you are going to be in northern Colombia and is often listed as a must-see of South America if you are doing a long trip.

Unfortunately![](colombia/cartagena_opt.jpg "Cartagena Club"), we didn’t have time to see much of the rest of northern Colombia  such as the dunes up north or the coffee villages in the mountains to the East.  We decided to head back to Cartagena and hang out there with some friends for a few days.  There was a couple that we had seen in many countries (Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Colombia).  We knew that this would be the last city we saw them in since we were starting to move more quickly through South America.  So, it was nice to have a few chill days to hang out with them, do some walking tours, and explore the great art and graffiti in Cartagena before we parted ways.

We then flew to Medellin to have a![](colombia/medellinAll_opt.jpg "Medellin together")  “vacation within a vacation” as we decided to call it.  We got to meet up with two of Luke’s friends from college and Elena’s mom!  They all travelled down from the U.S. and we got to catch up with them for a week!  This was a nice time where we could really feel settled for a week and get to share in some of our travel experiences with friends and family in person.  It was also a time where our friends could bring us some guilty pleasures from home such as Amazon purchases and delicious double-IPAs that were pretty much impossible to find for the last few months of travel.

It was also nice because we had some friends who lived in Medellin who showed us around, invited us into their lives, and hung out with us as much as they could.  Medellin will always have a special place in my heart because of the kindness and hospitality they showed us.  

Unfortunately, ![](colombia/medellin_opt.jpg "Medellin") I was feeling a little sick for the first day and a half of when family and friends arrived.  This was the first and only time I’ve been sick in the 4 months of this journey so far.  So, I can’t complain too much.  But due to not feeling too well and staying up late the night before, we decided to have a relaxing day where we went to take the public transportation and cable cars up to Parque Arvi.  This is a great place to get incredible views of the city and do some hiking in nature without too much effort.  After that, our Colombian friends invited us to play Tejo!  This is a Colombian game (most notably from the Bogota region) which is a mix between cornhole (bean bag toss) and EXPLOSIVES.  Basically, you throw a large rock across the room and try to hit an explosive which creates a loud noise letting you know you got it.

Based on the timing of our trip, ![](colombia/brewfest_opt.jpg "brew fest")it was one of our Colombian friend’s birthdays just two days before we arrived.  So, the Friday night that we were there, we got to hang out with her friends and celebrate her birthday with a birthday party.  This was a fun way to hang out with locals and see how their traditions are both different and similar to our customs and traditions in the US.

The next day, we hung out at a local brewery event drinking different Colombian craft beers and listening to live music.  This was a fun way to see how locals  enjoy themselves on a Saturday very similarly to how some might partake in a Saturday afternoon in the US.

Unfortunately, my two friends had to leave the next morning to fly back to work at their jobs. What are these so-called jobs?? ;)  

So, Elena, Elena’s mom![](colombia/comuna13_opt.jpg "comuna 13"), and myself explored some other cool attractions in the area.  We did an amazing Comuna 13 tour.  This is basically what used to be a very poor and dangerous neighborhood in northern Medellin.  However, it used the power of ART to transform the community into a major tourist attraction.  Now, the community is covered in beautiful grafitti art and murals covering most houses, walkways, and walls.  The entrepreneurial spirit of this neighborhood truly changed the lives of so many people through art and storytelling.

The last day we were in Medellin, we went to the famous El Penol to get views of Guatape.  We started the morning with a ride and a tour of one of our Colombian friend’s father’s avocado farm.  Unfortunately, avocados weren’t in season at the time, so we didn’t get to eat too much guacamole. But it was still very nice to get a tour and see this man’s passion.  After the farm, we arrived at El Penol which is an extremely large rock that you can climb.  It seems very out of place in the environment.![](colombia/guatape_opt.jpg "rock")  But it provides for a great workout to get the top.  Once at the top, you are rewarded with beautiful views of the surrounding lakes with amazing colors of blue. 

Unfortunately, Elena and I will be travelling through South America a little faster than Central America and won’t be able to see everything.  It is such a big continent and travelling by land means that it could take a few days between certain key places.  So, this is all we are able to see of Colombia for now.  We will definitely be back to see more of southern Colombia in the future!  We can’t wait!

But for us, it is now time to fly to Lima, Peru and experience a different culture, climate, and food!  We can’t wait to be in Inca country and learn all about it!


#### Money Saving Tips Used This Trip:

* Pack your own food and water for Tayrona National Park.  Prices are high once you are in the park.
* Find a hostel with free filtered water in Cartagena.  You can’t drink the tap water here.
* Get your beers from shops and drink on the streets, waterfront, or the old city walls. This is much cheaper than the bars or discos.
* Share Uber rides between 3-4 people makes the rides quite cheap in Medellin.
