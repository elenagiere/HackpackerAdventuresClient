We are quickly learning that there are so many subcultures within Mexican culture.  Trading the peacefulness and calamity of the Oaxaca region for the tourism grind of the Yucatan Peninsula is vastly different in many ways.  ![](yucatan/tulum_us_opt.jpg "Tulum") One of the first things our hostel receptionist told us when we got to Merida is that the food is very different in the Yucatan Peninsula compared to the rest of Mexico.  It's more rare to find the traditional and delicious Al Pastor. It is more likely that you'll find the tacos more "Mayan" style, served with cochinita or lechon: a much more sweet taco similar to pulled pork.

Based on the way our flights and travel schedule worked out, we decided to skip the bulk of Merida exploration for now and come back to it once we return from Cuba. From Merida, we went to our favorite city that we visited in all of the Yucatan Peninsula: Valladolid.  A small, bucolic town roughly equidistant between Merida and the infamous beach towns of Cancun or Tulum.  This place still had the quaint charm of a small town in Mexico which we love.  Yet it also was a place seeping with culture and history.

We did a phenomenal walking tour in Valladolid which informed us about the area, the traditions, and the food.  We even got a sneak peak tour at some of the tasty treats that the local markets work on for Day of the Dead celebrations which were only a few days away at the time.  Valladolid is also the nearest major city to one of the new 7 wonders of the world: Chichén Itzá.  Chichén Itzá is just as amazing as we thought it might be.  We got lucky and had a small group of people that were in the venue at the same time meaning we got picturesque views of the sun setting while admiring this great human feat.  The pyramids and Mayan ruins of this place were truly remarkable.  To make things even better, there are a few cenotes around Chichén Itzá as ![](yucatan/bigCenote_opt.jpg "Cenote") well as Valladolid. In fact, my favorite cenote in the Yucatan that we visited was a large cenote only three blocks from Valladolid’s central plaza.  There was no need to take a bus, no crowds, and it provided the highest cliff jumps into the cenote that we could find.  Cenote Zaci had it all. Best of all, they were setting up a Day of the Dead festival right outside the cenote that we could browse and see the celebrations starting to commence.

From Valladolid, we took a bus straight to Tulum.  While Cancun and Playa Del Carmen may have the party atmosphere, Tulum was more our speed in that it was much more backpacker friendly with chill vibes, delicious street food, and closer cenotes.  We stayed at an amazing hostel with free bike rentals.  So, we could go explore the town, the beaches, and the nature of this great place easily and at our own pace.  We came across an incredible free art museum on the beach with a meditation retreat happening right behind it.  It had absolutely stunning views of the ocean and the shore.  Tulum also has Mayan ![](yucatan/smallCenote_opt.jpg "Small Cenote") ruins right along the ocean which is a different setting than the previous ruins we had seen so far.  Tulum also has some amazing lagoons close by which were spectacular.  

Eventually, we needed to make our way to the Cancun airport to catch a flight back for a friend’s wedding near Philadelphia.  So, we headed north to check out Playa Del Carmen and Cancun for a few days.  These cities were unfortunately a little too touristy for our liking but they certainly had a lot to offer.  We did a great snorkel tour out on Cozumel island and saw some beautiful fish and rays.  But honestly, if you are going for the marine life, then perhaps consider a better destination like Honduras’ Bay Islands or the many dive/snorkel sites of Belize.  Instead, most people come to Cancun and Playa for the beaches.  There are endless souvenir shops, restaurants to grab a drink at the beach, or places to relax in an all inclusive resort.  If that is your speed, then I think you’ll love Cancun and Playa.

After a few days sabbatical from the Yucatan Peninsula (friend’s Philadelphia wedding, then Cuba), we returned thankful to get a few more tacos in before heading further ![](yucatan/bacalar_opt.jpg "Bacalar") south into Central America.  We flew back to Merida and did a great walking tour of the city seeing amazing art and hearing about the history of this city.  Merida has gotten many awards and recognition for its contribution to preserving Mexican culture.  From traditional music to showcasing reenactments of ancient Mayan sports, this city can showcase a lot.  

From Merida, we made our last stop in Bacalar before entering the Central American  country of Belize.  Many people call Bacalar “the new Tulum.”  It is absolutely a necessary stop on the backpacker trail.  Many people who we met in Oaxaca told us it was their favorite place in Mexico, so we had to stop and explore for a few days.  While much harder to get to from a major airport, this sleepy town was absolutely stunning.  The lagoons, the cenotes, the proximity to everything, and the extremely laid back vibes made this one of our favorite places in Mexico.  Doing a sunrise paddle boat tour can be difficult to wipe the grogginess off  at first, but so rewarding once you start gliding on the glassy lagoon ![](yucatan/sunrise_us_opt.jpg "Small Cenote")and eat a delicious tropical fruit breakfast out on the water while watching the sun rise and change the colors of the water.  It is a stunning place that surely will become busier and more crowded over the next few decades.  

Now, we’re going to take a break from Spanish and visit the English speaking country of Belize: a place with some of the best reef snorkeling and marine wildlife on the planet!

#### Money Saving Tips Used This Trip:

* Instead of doing the normal day ticket to visit the famous Chichen Itza, you can opt for a ticket that is half off of the regular price to see the sites for an hour and a half after the tickets close to the general public.  Not only was the ticket at a 50% discount, but there were almost no crowds, meaning you can get amazing pictures with no one there.  Also, the lighting is better as it is closer to “golden hour,” so it is better for pictures at this time.  Win, win, win situation if you ask us.
* Even though Uber and the taxi companies have gone through various legal battles, you actually can take an Uber to the Cancun airport as well as around Cancun.  I imagine there will be even more Ubers in the area over the coming months.  Our Uber to the airport was half the price of the cheapest taxi we could find. Note - you can’t get an Uber FROM Cancun airport.  Only to it.
* We found a few hostels that gave us free bike rentals.  This is fantastic in places like Tulum or Cancun where the downtown areas are not right along the beach.
* Food and restaurants are definitely more expensive in the Yucatan due to the higher levels of tourism.  Try to cook more here versus going out to eat.
* Skip the prices and the crowds of Cenote Ik Kil.  Go instead to Cenote Zaci in Valladolid.  The entrance is a third of the price and there were almost no people there compared to the many crowds at Ik Kil.  The cliff jumping is also better at Zaci.
* Do as many walking tours as you can in cultural places like Merida and Valladolid.  There is so much history to learn in this area for a reasonable price.
