Baja California was the perfect start to this year long journey.  We were impressed and delighted by the friendliness and openness of the local people.  We salivated day after day over delicious al pastor and fish tacos.  And we enjoyed our days relaxing and reading at the incredible local beaches with great weather and few crowds.

We started our journey in the infamous city of Tijuana located just across the border from San Diego.  I can’t tell you how many of my friends and family warned me or were in shock by the fact that we were going to visit “such a dangerous city.”  While I won’t say that the city is without its dangerous parts, it’s similar to most major cities in that it has its good areas and bad areas.  Simply avoid the bad areas, and use common sense while in the good areas.  We had nothing but great experiences in this city for the three days were here.  We got to explore the beaches along the ![](baja/tjSunset_opt.jpg) coast, getting cheap drinks and great views of the sunset.  We also brewery hopped at the many cheap and delicious breweries throughout the city.  All the while, we checked out things like the Tijuana Cultural Center and several of TJ’s more famous markets.

The thing that surprised me the most about Tijuana was probably the many breweries and delicious variety of beers it had for half of the price of US breweries.  Most second or third world countries that I have visited tend to have the same cheap beer everywhere, just with a different name.  But Tijuana is so close to the border that it clearly has gotten some influence on its culture from the US.  They had IPAs, Sours, even Peanut Butter Porters.  Those are some of the most unique and difficult to brew styles which shows that TJ is quickly catching onto the brewery scene, much to the delight of American and Mexican tourists alike.

After Tijuana, we went down to Rosarito, just a 20 minute drive south of TJ.  The beaches were significantly better here, and it was quickly apparent that this was a “cruise town” with a dock from the ocean that went straight to the nicest hotel and best bars/clubs on the beach.  We walked on the beach for a while and checked out the pool at the Rosarito Hotel, but quickly realized that this place was a little too fancy for us and not quite our speed.  We were ready to get back to our Couchsurfing host and hang out with some friends that we had just met.  

For those that don’t know, Couchsurfing is a phrase commonly used to mean sleeping on a friend’s couch for the night.  What some may not know is that it is also a full blown community of like-minded people who believe that “sharing is caring.”  It is basically an ability to find a host or invite a surfer on a mass, global scale.  Of course, there are ways to verify both your host and your surfer through verified means as well as their profile and reviews.  Therefore, you can be sure you are surfing with or hosting a sane, polite, and friendly individual or individuals.

In this case, in Rosarito, we were surfing with a lovely woman who was also hosting two people who were riding bicycles throughout the US and Mexico (after doing similar trips in Southeast Asia and other parts of the world).  Yes, some people travel differently compared to others. ;)

While her place was a little small, her hosting ability was nothing short of spectacular.  She showed us an amazing place to get an entire dinner for less than $2 which included a drink, soup, meat, beans, rice, and unlimited freshly made corn tortillas.  It was amazing.  And believe it or not, she or any of the surfers she has been with haven’t ever gotten sick there.  So, the food was fresh and reliable and incredibly cheap.  Later, she took us to see where the Titanic was filmed and where ![](baja/rosaritoCoffee_opt.jpg "evening coffee outing") the movie stars ate while they were on set.  She even mentioned that Leo sometimes pays the place a visit when he has a free weekend.  We ended the night with some hot chocolates overlooking the sunset and saw a party where a successful marriage proposal just occured.

The next day, we visited Ensanada which had a lovely downtown area and the best fish tacos we had up to this point in the trip.  The only thing we found truly unique about Ensanada is that it has an enormous flag in the heart of the downtown area which measures roughly 164 ft by 92 ft.  Apparently, it is one of the biggest in Mexico.  Other than that, the area is nice with shops, and ice cream parlors, and taco stands.  But nothing truly stands out.  What IS great about Ensanda is that it is the closest major city to Valle de Guadelupe which was an amazing area full of wineries.  We visited 5 or 6 different wineries and found out that it is very popular to do a day or weekend trip directly from Tijuana or San Diego.  I would highly recommend this for any of my Southern California friends as this was a great experience.  Similar to any US winery experience, you’ll find polite bartenders, warm sun dresses, people picnicking and enjoying their lives.  Probably the most popular winery here is Mount Xanic with one of the only lakes in the area (reservations usually required in advance).  But if you visit the Valle, you must also visit Vinedos Malagon which is a smaller but much more intimate winery.  We talked with the owner for over an hour while he poured us glass after glass of free wine.  A great ![](baja/wineCountry_opt.jpg "wine vineyards") guy who truly believes more conversation with a few people is better than less conversation with many people.

When we got back to Ensanada, we stumbled upon a house party which the hosts invited us to join them in tacos and cervezas.  Again, this was just another one of the many instances showing how welcoming, sharing, and safe we have felt with the people of Mexico.  There are so many good people in this country.

After realizing it was going to be a 22 hour bus ride down to Cabo San Lucas in the southernmost tip of Baja California, we decided to take a 2 hour flight.  Thank goodness it was actually cheaper to fly than to bus.

Cabo San Lucas was a vastly different experience from the northern Baja Peninsula (or Baja del Norte as the state is called).  Cabo San Lucas felt like we were back in the United States.  There were tourists and vacationers from the United States all over the place.  It wasn’t until later that we realized why.  It was the weekend of Sammy Hagar’s infamous birthday party held in Cabo Wabo every year.  While some may know Sammy for his time spent in the band Van Halen, he has also done quite a lot of solo work as well.  After looking up more details about Cabo San Lucas, we realized that this is one of the biggest parties and biggest events of the city.  This explains all of the American fans everywhere.

I can see why people who visit Cabo are often repeat visitors.  The place is beautiful with stunning beaches, amazing cliffs, and delicious tacos.  While the hawkers and street vendors can be a little annoying in the main marina area, the beaches are more of a safe haven where you can go and enjoy food or beers while floating in the waves.  One of the first things we did was to walk to some of the most famous beaches in the area, Divorce and Lovers beaches, situated back to back on the ocean side and marina side respectively.  As legend has it, the lovers beach is much more calm and swimmable and is great for lovers.  But when you are ready to divorce, you take your spouse to the ocean side where the waves are big, the currents are strong, and you can float your spouse out to sea forever.

Cabo was a great end to a great first week in Mexico!  At this point, we are trading our beach days in for some higher elevations in Mexico City and the mainland. :)
