When it comes to working out while traveling long term, we have struggled to find ![](health/funnyWorkout_opt.jpg "funny photoshop") time to do it not because we lack the free time, but because we lack the routine that our life once had back in California. Over the course of the last 3.5 months, I have gone for 1 run around town, gone to one proper gym to lift weights, and completed a handfull of improvised workouts just on the floor of the hostel dorm. From time to time, Luke has suggested working out while we wait for something or to make a completely chill day a little more productive like when we were spending the entire day on a beach.

Although we haven't completed many traditional workouts over the last few months, we have been way  more active in general considering that we don't sit at a desk for 8 hours 5 days a week. We walk a lot around everywhere we go. We seek ![](health/roadsideWorkout_opt.jpg "Roadside workout") out hikes whenever there are opportunities to get into nature. We get into the water and swim around when we are near natural pools of water. I think we are ok with the fact that our life doesn't cater to the workout lifestyle.
