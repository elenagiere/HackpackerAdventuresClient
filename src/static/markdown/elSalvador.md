Next on the journey south from Guatemala was El Salvador - a tiny and often skipped country on the Central America backpacker route.  In fact, El Salvadorians even have a common hashtag to try to convince more tourists to visit. #dontskipelsalvador was seen in many different places throughout what we saw of the country.  We decided that we would indeed give this country a chance and see what it had to offer.  While, we didn’t get to explore the country in its entirety, I would say that we thoroughly ![](salvador/beachSunset_opt.jpg "beach sunset") enjoyed the parts and places that we did see.

It had been quite a while since we had tasted the salt water of the Pacific Ocean.  Our last time was when we were sweltering in the heat of Cabo, Mexico nearly two months ago.  So, it was nice that our first destination in El Salvador was back to the coast to see the waves crashing again.  The quiet surfing town of El Tunco is probably the most popular backpacker destination in El Salvador with its plethora of beaches and incredible surfing scene.  That being said, it didn’t seem too popular when we arrived.  There were two big surfing competitions about two weeks before we arrived.  It seemed that everyone left the town after those were finished.  In a way, that was kind of nice.  We got the place to ourselves with only a few locals and die-hard surfers left in town.  It certainly made finding a surfing instructor quite easy and uncrowded sunset views from rooftop bars weren’t things to be upset about either.  

We were also very excited to try the famous El Salvadoran pupusas!  A pupusa is basically a thick flatbread made from cornmeal that is stuffed with cheese and several other ingredients.  El Salvador doesn’t seem to be known for much in the western world.  But pupusa food trucks and restaurants seem to be available in almost any major city with hints of a culinary scene.  We were excited to see how cheap and available pupusas were everywhere costing anywhere between $0.25-$0.75 USD per pupusa.  With two or three of these ![](salvador/surfLesson_opt.jpg "surfing lesson") pupusas, you’ll absolutely be full for the night.  Our European friends couldn’t always handle eating so much cheese for every meal.  For us, knowing we would only be here a few days, and tapping into our American heritage, we knew we could handle it!

The next morning, Elena grabbed a surfboard and took a surfing lesson for the first time.  Her ability to learn quickly and her knowledge of riding a snowboard on the snow made her an unstoppable force.  She got up on the board and owned the waves several times.  She looked like a natural.  Maybe this was going to be her new calling?  That is what I thought as well.  That is, until the evening when her shoulders and arms were so sore from paddling all morning that she could barely lift a bottle of water to her mouth. 

Thankfully, the next day, we rested our arm muscles and prepared to move our legs while exploring the small country’s capital of San Salvador.  Some people may recognize San Salvador for being one of the most ![](salvador/marketE_opt.jpg "San Salvador Markets") dangerous and most murderous cities back in the 80’s and even more recently in 2015 and 2016.  With its storied past, many travellers (Americans especially) choose to skip this beautiful city.  What people tend to ignore whether intentionally or unintentionally, is that the murders in these countries are almost  always related to gangster on gangster violence.  Tourists are almost never targeted.  That being said, we knew that we needed to be a little more careful in this city.  We carefully researched which places were the best and safest.  And we took Ubers and taxis when needed to explore different parts of the city.  And we made sure to travel just during the daylight.

That being said, there was absolutely nothing alarming or scary about our visit to San Salvador.  We  explored an incredible museum of modern art, the city’s largest cathedral, a beautifully colorful church, a ![](salvador/colorfulChurch_opt.jpg "Colorful Church") bustling street market, and several monuments.  We tried to book a walking tour, but we were unfortunately too late in booking it.  Because of that, we decided to find a Civil War museum to learn more about the country’s past, trying to determine why there was so much violence in this small country.  What was somewhat nice and somewhat eerie was that most of the museums and tourist attractions we went to were very empty.  It was clear that the violence in this country has taken a toll on its tourism market.  This has  almost certainly driven prices down and hurt the economy.  But maybe the #dontskipelsalvador hashtag will slowly get backpackers and tourists to see that there is beauty in everything - even a small, poor country like El Salvador.

That being said, we didn’t have much time to dedicate to El Salvador as we had to keep moving to keep up with our schedule of seeing the rest of Central and South America.  There are amazing volcanoes and rainforests to hike as well as beautiful treks and waterfall rappelling out in El Salvador’s incredible landscapes.  But we’ll have to save those for another trip.

For us, we were preparing for a long 10 hour overland bus trip through the south of Honduras and through to one of my all-time favorite countries of Nicaragua!


#### Money Saving Tips Used This Trip:

* Shop around to find the best hotel deals when it is off peak season.
* Enjoy local cuisine like 25 cent pupusas.
* Ask your Uber driver if he’ll make a detour to see a local monument that is not directly on the way to your destination.  Give him a tip for his effort!
