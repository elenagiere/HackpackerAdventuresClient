While the beaches in Baja were a great start to the trip, it was time to explore more of the heart of Mexico: Mexico City.  When we were in Japan a few years ago, we woke up at 3 am to get in line for nearly 4 hours to witness the last sumo wrestling tournament of the year.  Fortunately for us, we met a lovely Mexico City couple in front of us in line with which we chatted and passed the time.  We ended up staying loosely connected with them throughout the years.  Well, after all this time, we finally reconnected and got to see them.  They invited us to stay with them in their lovely apartment in a ![](cdmx/cdmxFriends_opt.jpg "Dinner at our friend's restuarant") great area of Mexico City.  Not only did they invite us into their home to stay for a few days, but they also invited us out to meals, cooked us breakfast, took us to art shows, and gave us lots of travel information and history on their great country.  This was just another great example of the kindness and generosity of the Mexican people. (Thanks again, Tania and Luis!)

While there are endless things to explore in Mexico City, we had to start somewhere.  We spent our first day in Mexico City exploring the Castillo Chapultepec and Chapultepec Park.  At over 7,000 feet in elevation, this city was much cooler with more trees and shade coverage than the more dry coastal areas of Baja California.  We appreciated the change to the cooler climate and slightly more rain to keep things cool.

Any trip to Mexico City would be remiss if it didn’t include a walking tour of the Zócalo.  The Zócalo is the historical heart of Mexico City.  Here, you can you find impressive buildings, ![](cdmx/cdmxZocalo_opt.jpg "Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral") cathedrals, and art museums. But you can also find Aztec Ruins buried right underneath some of these incredible structures.  As the legend has it, the Aztecs were told to build their city when they see an eagle eating a snake on top of a cactus.  The Aztecs wandered until they finally saw that happen in the Mexico City region.  And this is why they settled there.  The symbol of this eagle eating a snake can still be found on the Mexican flag today, showing Mexico’s roots with these native tribes.

The next day, we did a boat tour of Xochimilco.  A series of canals with colorful boats made this a vibrant and lovely place to spend a few hours on a Saturday afternoon.  We met a few new friends on our boat ride and even ![](cdmx/xochimilco_opt.jpg "Xochimilco boats") got a tour from a local about the endangered Mexican axolotl which used to live in these canals.  The magical and mysterious salamander (look up pictures if you haven’t seen it), was only native to this area of Mexico for a long time.  According to our guide, there are only two major locations where these axolotl exist and they are kept very sacred in the local community.

Another must as a day trip from Mexico City is to visit the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon in Teotihuacán.  Teotihuacán is known to most likely have been the largest city in the pre-Colombian Americas with over 125,000 residents.  These pyramids are absolutely massive and are a marvel to behold.  Constructed in two phases, the Pyramid of the Sun is one of the top ten largest pyramids in the world by volume.

If you are Catholic or are interested in religious culture, then another great stop is the famous Basílica de Guadalupe.  Another massive building in Mexico City, this basílica is an impressive sight to see.  More than 12 million people visit the Basílica of our Lady Guadalupe each year, making it one of the most travelled pilgrimages of all time - even more than the pilgrimage to Mecca.  Around the basílica, you can go to an actual service, you can find a tour guide, or you can stroll through their museum.  Whether you are interested in the basílica’s history or architecture, there is something here for everyone.

If you are a fan of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) or if you are a fan of the Jack Black movie Nacho Libre, then going to see a Lucha Libre in Mexico City is also quite an entertaining way to spend a few hours.  Outside the venue, you can buy a lucha libre mask to wear during the  ![](cdmx/luchalibre_opt.jpg "Lucha Libre Match") event if you so please to support your favorite Lucha Libre wrestler.  Inside the event, you see the acrobatic characters flying around, doing backflips and crazy tricks to pin their opponents.  The lucha libre wrestlers must be careful, however, because if they get de-masked, then they can no longer wear their mask for the rest of their career.  While this is not as historical as other things in Mexico City, I think it is a fun way to see how the locals spend their free time relaxing and cheering on their favorite lucha libres with an “Otra! Otra! Otra!”

If wrestling is too gaudy for you and you are looking for something a little more erudite, then consider checking out some of the famous art museums like Soumaya museum or Museo de Bellas Artes (Museum of Fine Arts).  For cities that are known to have the most museums, Mexico City is right up there with the best of them.  It feels like the city has a new museum every two blocks or so. 

While there are countless other things to explore in this city, we had to continue on our journey to our ![](cdmx/soumayaMuseum_opt.jpg "Soumaya Art Museum") next destination.  We are certainly excited to go back to Mexico City someday to visit again.  But for now, we are off to Oaxaca - the city and region known for delicious and unique foods such as mole, tlayudas, and tejate!

#### Money Saving Tips Used This Trip:
* Get your feet ready for plenty of walking - enjoy the sights and smells as you meander

* Stay at a friend’s place if you have friends in town
* Find free walking tours which operate based on tips at the end of the tour depending on how good you thought the tour was
