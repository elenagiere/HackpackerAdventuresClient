For those who don’t know, Belize is decidedly different than what most people think of when they hear “Latin America.”  Firstly, it is English speaking.  Secondly, tacos, enchiladas, and empanadas are noticeably more difficult to find.  Instead, you’ll find American food such as burgers, pizza, and stouts.  They also tie their currency to the US dollar meaning that you could use US dollars and Belize dollars in the same ![](belize/belizeCityElena2_opt.jpg "Belize City") transaction, with the Belize dollar being worth half of 1 USD.  Lastly, you’ll find that the people and culture is much more Afro-Caribean and much less Hispanic.  All of these things made it a unique contrast to being in Mexico before and being in Guatemala after.

We started our time in Belize City, the country’s largest city.  Belize City used to be the capital of the country until a hurricane in 1961 almost wiped it out.  We were lucky enough to have a family friend who lived most of her life in Belize City.  She was able to give us insight into the culture, the activities, and the life of a local.  You would think that the largest city in Belize would offer plenty to do for tourism.  However, the city itself is decidedly local.  Most people use Belize City as a jumping off point for heading to the Keys (Cayes) or heading inland to the mountains.

Again, we got a bit lucky in that we happened to be in town on one of the biggest Belizean holidays: Garifuna Settlement Day.  The Garifuna people are a mixed indigenous people who came from the Caribbean.  The Afro-Caribbean Garifuna people originally descended from West African slaves who landed in St. Vincent in the Caribbean in 1635 while most likely heading to the Americas to work in mines and plantations.  We went to a huge Garifunda gathering/festival and ate a food called ![](belize/belizeFood_opt.jpg "Hudut") Hudut which reminded me a lot of the West African dish of Banku and Tilapia.  Most likely, the Garifunda food was derived from their West African ancestors.  We also were the only non-Belizeans at this event.  So, much to the delight and laughter of the locals, they loved teaching us Garifunda dance.  They were moving their hips effortlessly.  We moved our hips more than we knew was possible and still couldn’t come close to smoothness of their beautiful dance.  Regardless, it was fun to learn and to entertain these amazing people while they enjoyed their holiday.

The reason that most tourists come to Belize is for the snorkeling, reef diving, and marine wildlife.  So, from Belize City, we took the 45 minute ferry to Caye Caulker. ![](belize/cayeCaulker_opt.jpg "Caye Caulker Sunrise") This little key was a diver’s paradise.  Backpacker hostels, cheap restaurants, and dive shops galore: the Belizean keys is definitely a must stop location for anyone who loves the reefs and the ocean.

The first day in Caye Caulker, we decided to do a day trip snorkeling the infamous Blue Hole.  The Blue Hole was formed similarly to the many cenotes we saw in the Yucatan Peninsula.  However, it is different in that is is filled with seawater in lieu of fresh groundwater.  The snorkeling in and around Caye Caulker was by far the best snorkeling or diving I have ever done.  And it’s no wonder.  The Great Belize Barrier Reef is the largest reef system in the northern hemisphere, the largest living reef system, and the second largest reef behind Australia’s Great Barrier Reef.

Belize is one of the few places where you can see the Antillean manatee - an animal that some say may go extinct in as soon as 50 years or less.  We were lucky enough to be able to see these animals in the water at a safe distance, so as not to disturb the gentle creature.  We also saw three different species of rays (including the beautiful eagle ray), three different species of sea turtles (Green sea turtle, Loggerhead sea turtle, and a Hawksbill sea turtle), ![](belize/manateeAir_opt.jpg "Manatee") two friendly species of shark (nurse and reef sharks), lobsters, sea horses, octopus, jumping tarpons, and more fish than I could possibly remember all the names of.  The Hol Chan Marine Reserve was an incredible place where you truly feel like a mermaid (or merman), swimming amongst all of these beautiful sea creatures.  This was definitely the highlight of Belize and one of my favorite underwater adventures.

After a few days, we decided to trade the reefs and the waves for the mountains and caves of Western Belize.  We did a very interesting cave tour through the Actun Tunichil Maknal caves, more commonly referred to as the ATM caves for obvious reason.  While most cave tours that I have done were known for their natural and geological beauty.  This cave has this AND more.  These caves are beautiful and also have Mayan archeological remains including stoneware, pottery, and even human bones!  Yes, skeletal remains of Mayans were found here and thought to be sacrificed individuals to the gods during Mayan ceremonies.  It is quite unreal to see skeletal remains in real life.  Needless to say, this was an amazing little canyoneering/caving adventure to see how a past civilization lived.

Next, we cross the border into Guatemala to chase waterfalls, lakes, and volcanoes!

#### Money Saving Tips Used This Trip:

* Stay with a family friend to help save on accommodation if possible.
* Talk to a tour company to get coupons/vouchers for half price ferry rides to the Cayes.
* Cook your own food when possible.  Grocery stores and markets have many great options.
* ATM Cave tours are cheaper leaving from San Ignacio versus Unitedville.
* Take a local chicken bus from Belize City to San Ignacio.  It is much cheaper than the shuttle options.
* Appreciate the higher percentage Belekin Stout beers as they are somehow the cheapest beer in the country versus a light beer.
