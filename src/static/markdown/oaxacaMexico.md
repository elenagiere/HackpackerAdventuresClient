Leaving the hustle and bustle of Mexico City, we decided to trade our days for some more low key times in the very cultural region of Oaxaca, Mexico.  Right away, we fell in love with the area.  It wasn’t the activities or sightseeing that we loved.  It was the ambiance, the people, and the ways the town makes you feel.  Street vendors are significantly less pushy here and are ok if you don’t ![](oaxaca/oaxacaCity_opt.jpg "Oaxaca City Streets") come into their shop to look around.  Also, the food is incredible and has the most diversity of Mexican food that we have been able to find in Mexico.  Oaxaca is home to the infamous mole negro, the tlayuda and a delicious drink called tejate (similar to horchata).  Yet the area still boasts the traditional Al Pastor taco, empanada, or enchilada.

The first night that we arrived in town, there was a parade going right past our hostel for over an hour.  Some watched from the roof of the building while others joined in the mayhem on the streets.  Regardless of where you choose to watch the local party, you were sure to be showered with candy and shots of mezcal.  Yes, half empty bottles of mezcal were even thrown up to those watching from the roof of the two story building, much to the delight of the many young, cheap backpackers.  It was an incredible experience.  And apparently is was also not that uncommon.  We were told these parades happen more or less on a weekly basis.  I always knew that Mexicans love to party, but I had no idea it was at this level or with this frequency.  It just goes to show that the people in this region appreciate a good work/life balance.

The next day, we went to a famous watering hole about an hour away called “Hierve El Agua.”  It is ![](oaxaca/hierveelagua_opt.jpg "Hierve El Agua") actually a petrified waterfall made from mineral deposits over many centuries.  Today, it makes a great place to swim, look out over the mountains, and even do some small hikes.  It made for a beautiful day trip up in the mountains.

Oaxaca boasts numerous markets that serve all kinds of different Mexican foods.  If you are a foodie, then a visit to Oaxaca is a must.  They have food in this region that we haven’t found in any other place in Mexico.  The signature dish of this region definitely goes to the mole negro which is a chocolate/molases based sauce that typically drenches a chicken served with rice, beans and (of course) tortillas.  However, the equally as unique food we found was the tlayuda which some would call “Mexico’s pizza.”  And of course, Oaxaca is the region most famously known for mezcal, a cousin to the more popularized tequila.  Mezcal, while smokier than tequila, can be equally as smooth when distilled properly.  While both mezcal and tequila are distilled from the agave plant, tequila can only be made from the blue Weber agave plant and is typically known to come from the Tequila region of Mexico.  Mezcal, on the other hand, can be made from any of the 30+ different agave plants.  This means mezcal can have significantly more variety of flavors and tastes.

While the Aztec ruins were near Mexico City, the Zapotec people settled nearer to Oaxaca.  We were able to see these ruins as well at Monte Alban which were equally as impressive ruins and pyramids to explore.

We were enjoying the mountainous region of Oaxaca so much that we postponed our journey to the beaches a few days longer.  We decided to take a few days and head to a smaller village up high in ![](oaxaca/sanjoseforest_opt.jpg "Mountain forest") the mountains.  It was so high that we were literally in the clouds or above the clouds in this village setting of over 8,000 ft elevation.  Somehow, the misty clouds parted just enough to view the sunset on our second night.  It must have been one of the most spectacular sunsets that I’ve ever seen.

This area had amazing hiking in an eerie, misty, jungle-like setting.  The cool breezes and light rain were a nice trade from the hot days sweating on the beaches.  Speaking of sweating, we also participated in a Temazcal which could be thought of as a sweat lodge used in indigenous tribes.  Basically, it was a small adobe hut with benches around the perimeter on the inside of the hut.  Stones were heated over a fire for three hours and then gradually brought into a small pit in the middle of the hut.  This heat in such a small place definitely made you sweat and helped open your pores to cleanse your body.  This was a fun and exciting ritual to experience in such a beautiful, natural setting.

Unfortunately, our time in Oaxaca had to come to an end at some point.  At this point, we are heading to Merida, the cultural capital of the Yucatan peninsula to get some more days in the sun and the beaches.

#### Money Saving Tips Used This Trip:

* Find a good, but cheap hostel - some have free walking tours or free breakfast
* Use the collectivos or shared taxis to get to your destinations
* Find hostel friends who want to do similar activities with which you can share ideas, get recent feedback, and even carpool
* Eat in the markets (even vegetables or salads) because it is considered very safe here which is unlike most places in Latin America
* Do a Temazcal (indigenous purification ritual) in a smaller nearby town in lieu of the big, touristy packages in downtown Oaxaca
* Enjoy or participate in a local parade which happen frequently.  If you look like you’re not from Oaxaca, you will most likely get showered with candy and free shots of mezcal
