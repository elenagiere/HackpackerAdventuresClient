Nicaragua has always had a special place in my heart.  It was a country that I lived in previously for a few months after college.  Needless to say, I was excited to go back after a 6 year hiatus.  It has some of the best people and nature despite being one of the poorest countries in Latin America.

We took a long 10-hour  ![](nica/boarding_opt.jpg "Volcano Boarding") shuttle from El Tunco in El Salvador through the southern end of Honduras and made it to the quintessential backpacker city of Leon at around 1:30 in the morning.  Thanks to Elena’s hard work ethic, we were able to work on trip planning, dancing videos, website articles, etc.  And after the hard work is done, we have e-books, podcasts, music, audiobooks, and Netflix to watch.  So many followers of our blog wonder how we stay sane on such long journeys.  The truth is that we are very prepared with content and things to do.  The time can fly by if you are prepared.

We started off our time in Nicaragua with one of the most unique experiences that you can have in Central America - Volcano Boarding!  While you can board and sled down sand and dunes in various areas of the world, it is rare to find a place where you can board down a dormant volcano.  While this can be an incredibly fun and adrenaline rushed experience, it can also be quite dangerous.  For anyone who has hiked a volcano before, you know that often times the rocks are volcanic and extremely porous/sharp.  So, now imagine riding down a volcano at 40-50 mph and taking a tumble onto these rocks.  Yes, we have heard stories and even have friends who have gotten scraped up.  But thankfully, they give you the biggest and most ridiculous jump suits ever made to protect you in the case that you get a little out of control.  And thankfully, Elena and I both had successful journeys down the volcano.  We only had hundreds of tiny pebbles in our shoes and gloves by the end of it.  Check out our video below to see us in action riding down the volcano!

Being in ![](nica/telica_opt.jpg "Telica Volcano") Central America, you are on what’s called the “Ring of Fire.”  This is a path along the Pacific Ocean where many of the earth’s volcanoes and frequent earthquakes exist.  Therefore, you have to take advantage of being in volcano land  when you’re in Central America.  We spent the next day hiking up Telica volcano.  I loved this hike back in  2013 because it was the first time that I saw a lava lake with bubbling molten lava.  To this day, I describe it as one of the most spectacular natural wonders I have ever seen.  Unfortunately, the volcano erupted for several months in 2015.  One of the eruptions even caused ash to fall in Leon over 12 miles away!  But due to these eruptions, you can no longer see the lava lake in Telica.  Nevertheless, we still decided to get some exercise and hike this epic volcano.

What was interesting and very different from other countries we have been to in Central America is that for both the  volcano boarding as well as the Telica volcano hike, there were almost no tourists for either of these excursions.  There were two other travelers with us on the same tour for volcano boarding.  And we were the only two people (plus our guide) who were at the top of the Telica Volcano hike.  We wanted to find out why exactly that was, so we took a walking tour of Leon the next day.  There we learned that the civil war and political unrest from the previous two years have scared away a lot of tourism in Nicaragua.  But it is slowly gaining its reputation back.  ![](nica/leon_opt.jpg "Leon")  So, more and more travelers are visiting the country.  Nicaragua can still be a dangerous place but mainly for local Nicaraguans who are outspoken against the current political situation.  Many Nicaraguans would agree (in private, but never in public) that the current political regime is more of less of a quasi-dictatorship versus a true democracy.Therefore, tourists and international travelers are rarely in danger in Nicaragua.  But the Nicaraguans who are talking negatively about the government are the ones who can get themselves in trouble.  That being said, not all  travelers know these things before they visit Nicaragua due to lack of information being shared publicly on the internet.  So, this has greatly affected the tourism industry in Nicaragua.  But things are slowly getting better.  There is more positive feedback from backpackers and travelers through word of mouth which is helping Nicaragua regain its reputation as one of the best countries to visit in Central America.

After Leon, we decided to stay in Nicaragua’s northern region.  We took the local buses everywhere in Nicaragua and they  are extremely cheap and easy.  We bussed to Esteli which is known for their cigars as well as one of the largest cities in Nicaragua. ![](nica/somoto_opt.jpg "Somoto Canyon") We used this city as our jumping off point to visit the famous Somoto Canyon.  This is an amazing canyon which is (in my opinion) on par with some of the epic canyons in southern Utah in the United States.  It is a full day tour full of hiking, swimming, floating, cliff jumping, boating, bat caves, and more.  Depending on what season you go, water levels will be higher/lower and the water’s flow will be faster/slower.  We were in the dry season, so water levels were lower.  This was nicer because the speed of the water was slower so you could  really appreciate all of the different aspects of the canyon without being forced through it too quickly.  The lower water level also meant that the cliff jumps were higher.  Unfortunately, our GoPro battery died for the biggest cliff jump but it was around 55-60 feet.  This was a truly great and cheap day tour.

After Esteli, we explored Matagalpa, a city known for its coffee.  We did an amazing coffee tour getting to see the entire process from the picking of the berries, packing into bags, processing, drying, roasting, packaging, and exportation process.  It was also some of the best organic coffee I have ever tasted. ![](nica/treehouse_opt.jpg "Treehouse hostel")

Making our way south, Granada was the next stop in Nicaragua.  It is a must-see city with amazing cobblestone streets,  great restaurants, and the starting city for seeing things like Masaya Volcano (with a visible lava lake), Laguna de Apoyo (a great volcanic lagoon which is perfect for chilling on a hot day), and Las Isletas (a series of small islands formed by explosions from nearby volcanoes many many many years ago).  The outskirts of Granada is also the city where the famous Treehouse Hostel is located.  This is a hostel touted by backpackers as far north as the Yucatan Peninsula and as far south as Panama.  A true treehouse hostel in the middle of the jungle, this place has it all from howler monkeys, several rooftop platforms, bridges spanning from treehouse to treehouse, and amazing speakers for their famous treehouse jungle parties.  Most importantly though, it was great to do a community walking tour in the community where the treehouse hostel was located.  We could see how the Treehouse was giving back to the local community and supporting their education and creating jobs for the village.  We learned how to make tortillas, how to ground coffee by hand the traditional way, and saw adorable 2 week old puppies.

![](nica/sanjuan_opt.jpg "San Juan Del Sur") San Juan Del Sur was the next city on the list to visit.  A city known for its surf and its parties, we figured this would be a great place to spend our New Years Eve.  This was definitely “gringo” territory as many of the restaurants and  shops were clearly aimed at tourists, travelers, and backpackers.  Nevertheless, it was a fun city where many of the friends and travelers we met in various countries in Central America all seemed to congregate for New Years.  It was clearly the place to be and the place to celebrate making it to the next decade - 2020.  We saw people who we met in Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua all gathered here partying together.  It was an amazing time!

The last stop for us in Nicaragua was the island of Ometepe.  A mystical place, it was a great reprieve from the machismo  parties in San Juan Del Sur.  We were happy to find a place that seemed more chill and relaxed.  We stayed at a vegan, hippie hostel in the jungle for a few nights.  We did lots of yoga, chilled in natural pools, and played pool on a beach ![](nica/ometepe_opt.jpg "Ometepe") with your feet in the sand.  We ended our time there with a great permaculture tour, learning about sustainable living and sustainable farming.  It was a fantastic learning experience about how biodiverse plants, animals, and humans can coexist in a perpetually sustainable way.

And on that note, the next stop is to cross the border into Costa Rica - a land of rain forests, cloud forests, beaches, hot springs and everything in between!


#### Money Saving Tips Used This Trip:

* Nicaragua is one of the cheapest countries in Central America.  You can do a lot here on a low budget.
* Shop around at local hotelitos (small, usually family run hotel).  We found a hotel room that we could share between us for about $10/night.
* The local rum - Flor de Cana - is very cheap and is on par as one of the best rums in Central America, rivaling Havana Club (from Cuba) in my opinion.
* You can drink on the streets everywhere in Nicaragua, so grab a beer from the convenient store and go for a walk on the beach instead of buying an overpriced beer from a loud restaurant.
* Take the local buses.  They are easy to navigate and are much much cheaper than taking shuttles or private cars/taxis from city to city.
