This is one beautiful country.  The people with smiles perpetually on their faces, the beautiful blue water, and the many islands with different cultures all to their own all make this a very special country.

El Nido on the island of Palawan is still one of my all-time favorite places to visit.  And Elena and I got lucky enough to be able to visit this area before they had any ATMs in the entire region.  While this may seem like a hindrance, it was also a symbol of how undeveloped this area of the country was when we visited in 2016.  Due to the lack of infrastructure, this scared a lot of tourists away from this amazing place.  This meant that we got amazing boat tours and views of this amazing area for very cheap.  To put it into perspective, we had our own private room in a beachside hostel and it cost us about $5 each per night.  I could literally take pictures of the sunset off of our balcony over the beach.  Simply incredible place.  Again, this is one of those places where you have to see the pictures to paint the true picture.  El Nido was so special that it ended up making the banner photo of our website with my sitting on a rock overlooking the water and mountains.

To get to El Nido, most people fly into Puerto Princesa which is the capital and biggest city on the island of Palawan.  If you speak Spanish, you might notice that the names of these cities have a clear Spanish influence.  And they do.  Many of the places we visited in the Philippines had the classic Spanish endings of O or A.  Even the country’s capital, Manila encompasses this influence.

The Puerto Princesa Subterranean National Park is certainly one of the main attractions on the island.  It is a beautiful cave system that you can take a boat tour through.  As long as you aren’t afraid of bats, this is a must visit half day trip to take.

The people in the Philippines are just as friendly and welcoming as you might expect from Southeast Asia.  While it is hard to say which Southeast Asian country is the friendliest, The Philippines definitely gives Thailand and Vietnam a run for their money.

While this country does involve a lot of island hopping, it is a very special place which Elena and I will definitely visit again someday.  I’m glad to have gotten the opportunity to visit such an amazing country.
