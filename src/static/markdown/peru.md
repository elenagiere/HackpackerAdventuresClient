![](peru/ceviche_opt.jpg "Ceviche") Based on our schedule, we unfortunately had to skip western Colombia, Ecuador and northern Peru.  We are just going to have to do another trip someday to explore those places.

Instead, we flew from Medellin, Colombia to Lima, Peru.  We were very excited to get to explore a new country, new food, and new culture.  We landed and soon discovered that Lima is HUGE.  It is a massive city with many different districts and a population of about 8 million people.

We arrived at our hostel and decided to get a classic Peruvian dinner of anticuchos (cow heart).  It was stunningly delicious as was the first Pisco Sour that I have ever had.

The next day, we did a walking tour of the Barranco district.  This area had a lot of great graffiti art and our tour guide was able to explain the history and meaning behind each of the pieces.![](peru/limaArt_opt.jpg "Barranco Art")  Unlike many of the other countries we have been to so far on this big trip, there seemed to be a lot of Asian influence in Lima.  We learned that there is such a thing as Peruvian-Chinese cuisine most commonly served in a Chifa restaurant.  Given that we haven’t had much Chinese food on this trip, it was a pleasant surprise to get some of our favorite Chinese flavors - with a Peruvian twist, of course.

However, coastal Peru’s most famous food would definitely have to be the Peruvian ceviche.  And boy was it good.  We even decided to take a cooking class learning how to prepare and make this delicious ceviche.  We couldn’t get enough of this great dish when we were there.  We also took a class on how to make Pisco Sours.  While these are a little too sweet for my liking, it was nice to try a new drink and see how passionate the locals were about their pisco.

We also got to do tours of downtown Lima and the Miraflores district.  Both were great to see the variety that Lima has to offer.

![](peru/cusco_opt.jpg "Cusco") After a few hot days in Lima, we traded it for the cold highlands of Cusco, Peru.  Once the capital of the famed Incan empire, Cusco quickly stole our hearts as one of our favorite small/medium sized cities that we have been to so far in Latin America.  At over 11,000 feet in elevation, you quickly learn that you are in a high altitude city when you start walking up the hills in Cusco.  It takes time to acclimatize, and most tour operators recommend spending 2 days in Cusco before starting any trekking journeys to Machu Picchu.

We knew ahead of time when we booked our flights to Peru that February wasn’t the ideal time to visit Machu Picchu.  February is one of the rainiest months in the Cusco region. This means that hiking will be very wet and landslides are sometimes possible on the trails.  In fact, the Inca Trail is officially closed for the entire month of February every year.  So, we knew we weren’t going to be able to hike the Inca Trail.  However, we didn’t really want to hike the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu anyways.  We really wanted to hike the Salkantay Trail.  This is not as interesting in terms of the ruins and history of the Incas, but it has more![](peru/peruCarnaval_opt.jpg "Lima Carnaval") nature such as the famous Humantay Lake and high elevation Salkantay Pass.  We were all set to hike this and got a call at 9 pm the night before saying that the trail was closed to all tour operators due to the amount of rain and landslides, making the path very dangerous.  So, unfortunately for us, we had to schedule something different.  We decided to do a 4-day Inca Jungle tour instead.  This involves a few days of hiking, some mountain biking, hot springs, coffee tours, and hostels along the way.  While not as physically demanding as the Salkantay trek, this proved to still be a really fun few days.  And afterwards, we found out that the Salkantay Trail  and Inca Jungle Tour overlap for days 3, 4 and 5 of the Salkantay. So, it wasn’t too different in terms of the scenery and things we saw while hiking to Machu Picchu.  We even hiked for a while on an “Inca Trail.”  While not the official Inca Trail once walked by the Incan elite, the trail we hiked on was used for the class of Incas who did commerce and trade between Machu Picchu and Cusco.  It was still gorgeous and fun to walk through the jungle to Aguas Calientes.

![](peru/andes_opt.jpg "the Andes")Aguas Calientes is a cute little town just outside the entrance to Machu Picchu.  This was a fun place and happened to have a show happening in the main plaza in honor of it being Valentine’s Day the evening that we were there.  It was nice to be back in a real town instead of out in the mountains/jungle hiking our way towards Machu Picchu.

The next morning before the sun rose, we woke up at 4 am and started our hike up to Machu Picchu.  It was consistently raining as it had been for the majority of our hike to Machu Picchu.  Geared in our best rain jackets and ponchos, we started hiking up the almost 1,300 feet elevation gain from Aguas Calientes to Machu Picchu.  Despite some miscommunication from our tour guide, we made it to Machu Picchu and were entranced by the quality that the ruins seemed to still be in.  We have seen quite a lot of ruins from various indigenous people throughout this journey in Latin America, but I must say that the Machu Picchu ruins are definitely the coolest that we’ve seen.  Part of that,![](peru/machuPicchuHiking_opt.jpg "Machu Picchu") I think, has to do with the amazing backdrop and scenery that you see surrounding Machu Picchu.  The mountains are absolutely stunning and a beautiful sight in their own right.  We also did the hike up to Wayna Picchu, a nearby mountain overlooking Machu Picchu.  Unfortunately, the views were completely socked in when we got to the top of Wayna Picchu.  Some opted to stay and wait out the fog and clouds.  However, Elena and I knew that we had limited time in Machu Picchu, so we decided to head back down and explore the Machu Picchu ruins a little more.

Eventually, the views opened up and we got to see Machu Picchu in all its glory.  A truly remarkable and beautiful place.  If only there weren’t so many tourists there, it might have been one of my favorite things to see so far in Latin America.

Well, we eventually had to hike back down Machu Picchu and back to Hydroelectrico to take the 6 hour bus ride back to Cusco.  It was definitely a long day, with over 40,000 steps (most of which were in the rain) and lots of elevation gain plus a 6 hour bus ride, but we did it and were so glad we got to hike it.

![](peru/humantayUs_opt.jpg "Humantay Lake")Since we weren’t able to do the Salkantay Trek, we decided we would do a day trip to Humantay Lake.  It ended up being a beautiful, sunny day.  And the lake was absolutely epic.  They actually opened the lake up to tourists only 6 years ago.  So, it still was not too popular or overrun by people.  We got unobstructed views of this great lake and were glad we still got to hike a little more of the Salkantay Trail.  In the end, we more or less did days 1, 3, 4, and 5 of the Salkantay Trail.  It was just Day 2 with the Salkantay Pass that we had to miss due to landslides.  So, overall, I was very happy with the outcome of our time in Cusco given our constraints.

![](peru/islandkid_opt.jpg "Uros Islands")  After getting back to Cusco from our day trip to Humantay Lake, we immediately went to the bus station and got a cheap overnight bus to Puno, a city on Lake Titicaca.  This is famously known as the highest navigable lake in the world and the second largest lake in South America.

 When we were in Puno, we did a tour of the Uros people.  These indigenous people live on man made islands constructed of reeds that they cut and replenish as the floor of their island every 15 days.  This is one of the most fascinating ways to live that I have ever heard of.  But they are a group of about 2,500 people who live like this on these small islands.  Because of their unique![](peru/islandfloor_opt.jpg "Uros Islands") lifestyle, they don’t have to pay any taxes to the Peruvian government.  Living on the mainland and paying taxes would be too expensive for them given their lifestyle and way of life.  So, they continue to replenish their small islands with more reeds.

From Puno, we will continue into the Bolivian side of Lake Titicaca to a city on the water called Copacabana!  Despite recent political turmoil, we are excited to get to explore this high elevation, outdoorsy country!


#### Money Saving Tips Used This Trip:

* Buy your Machu Picchu ticket through the Ministry of Tourism government website.  This is much cheaper than going through 3rd party websites.
* Shop around for great deals on Salkantay or Inca Jungle tours.
* Reference Booking.com to find cheap accommodations in Cusco.
* There are many varieties of Pisco Sours to try in the grocery stores and are much cheaper than getting several drinks at a bar or restaurant.
* Take an overnight bus from Cusco to Puno to save on transportation and accomodation.  Shop around on price.  We found various prices from around $30 down to $6.  We took the $6 bus and were happy to find that they had reclining seats, heating, electric outlets for every seat, and a bathroom on board.  I’m not sure what the added benefits of the $30 bus were, but we were glad to get such a good deal.
