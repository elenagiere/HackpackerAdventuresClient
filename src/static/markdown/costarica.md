Going from Nicaragua to Costa Rica is quite the transition.  Firstly, everything costs at least twice as much.  Tours are way too expensive for most backpacker’s budgets compared to equivalent tours you could do in Nicaragua.  And locals tend to be more educated and speak a lot more English.  That being said, Costa Rica is an absolutely magically biodiverse country that we loved!

We didn’t budget a lot of time for Costa Rica, ![](costarica/waterfall_opt.jpg "waterfall")but we were glad for every single day we had there.  We got lucky and crossed the border with almost no line.  Some Nicaraguans try to work in Costa Rica to make better money.  But over the holidays, they travel home to Nicaragua to see family and friends.  Apparently, after New Years is a terrible time to try to cross the border into Costa Rica because so many Nicaraguans are returning to work in Costa Rica.  We heard a few scary stories of some friends and backpackers that got stuck at the border for 4-6 hours.  We skipped right through in almost 45 minutes.  So glad! 

We spent our first night in Costa Rica in the northern city of Liberia.  This was a great city to explore  the famous Rincon De La Vieja National Park.  It is a very unique place where you can walk through a wet tropical forest and also hike up to high elevation to see the rare and unique dry tropical forest.  We thought that a dry tropical forest sounded like an oxymoron at first.  But after learning more, we found out that the flora and fauna found in this forest are very ![](costarica/bridge_opt.jpg "bridge") different than the rest of Costa Rica.  We hiked to several beautiful waterfalls, and got to swim.  One waterfall even had a hot spring next to it where you could sit and enjoy the warm waters while watching the water falling.  Nature is amazing sometimes.  We also saw an anteater up high on a tree branch about 80 feet high.  We ended our hiking in the park by smelling the sulfur and seeing the many fumaroles and mud pits.

Next on the list, we made it up to Santa Elena - a small city in the highlands known for Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve  as well as Santa Elena Cloud Forest Reserve.  This was an amazing place that we absolutely loved.  It was up in the mountains.  So, we could finally escape the coastal Central American heat that we had experienced the previous month.  It felt like natural air conditioning all the time and we actually needed long pants and rain jackets at times.  This area was a place that we were told has the incredible looking ficus tree.  It is an amazing tree that grows around an existing tree and will stay in place once the original tree dies and decays.  This essentially makes an extremely easy tree to climb - but from the INSIDE of the tree.  I must say, I have climbed a lot of trees in my life, and this was the best tree climbing experience I’ve ever had.  It even opened up to a gorgeous view above the canopy once you climb to the top of the inside of the tree.  Absolutely stunning.![](costarica/ficas_opt.jpg "ficas tree")

We were so in love with this area  that we actually stayed an extra day so that we could hike in both Monteverde and Santa Elena Reserves.  These are both beautiful in their own way.  Santa Elena is more for those who want to really hike.  While Monteverde is slightly more touristy and pricey due to its reputation.  The amazing mysticism and variety of plants and animals in these two parks were absolutely incredible.  Along with the many monkeys, birds, and insects we found, we also finally got to see a rare quetzal - an elusive bird that is quite famous in Central America.  Every country we visited talked about quetzals and how hard they were to spot as they are very shy and often stay very high in the trees, far from eye sight.  It was quite a treat to finally see one before leaving Central America.

We traded the cool, temperate climate to head down to the hot and sweaty beach town of Jaco.  We happened to have a California friend who was in Jaco at the same time, so it was nice to catch up with him and see his thoughts on Costa Rica.  Jaco had quite the variety of food options.  It felt a bit like we were back in the United States with all of the food options like sushi, egg mcmuffins, falafel, burgers, and other gringo foods.  But other than the food, the beach wasn’t anything really special.  The beaches were just as good if not better in Nicaragua in my opinion. 

![](costarica/jaco_opt.jpg "jaco") We did a quick overnight trip to San Jose so that we could take the early morning bus out to Panama.  San Jose seemed much more dirty and seedy than I would have expected.  It was interesting to learn that while we were in Costa Rica, the US Travel Advisory changed the status of Costa Rica from a Level 1 (safe) to a Level 2 (less safe, use caution).  In other words, Costa Rica is becoming more dangerous.  And after being in San Jose for a night, that made a little more sense to us.  The area of town that we were in was one of the sketchiest areas we went in Central America, and we were only 4 blocks from downtown shopping areas!  Regardless, we were completely fine and most streets were well lit.  

But we were ready to wake up early and cross the border into Panama and explore the famous islands in Bocas Del Toro!


#### Money Saving Tips Used This Trip:

* Many national parks have a student discount even if you are a foreign student, so bring your student ID card with you if you are a student.
* Figure out what tours you want to do, and see if you have the option to do them in Nicaragua instead. ;P
* Cook more of your meals in shared kitchens versus eating out at restaurants.
* Casado (typical meal) is the name of the standard plate that is typically the cheapest dish on the menu.
* Take local buses everywhere.  They are easy to navigate and very comfortable.
