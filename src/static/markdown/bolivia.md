![](bolivia/copacabana_opt.jpg "Copacabana") We arrived in the small city of Copacabana eager to explore a new country.  We also learned that only a few short months ago (in December 2019), Bolivia removed its $160 visa fee for US citizens.  So, that meant we had extra money in our pockets to explore this great place!  

We started with a nice hike up to the top of a nearby hill (Cerro Calvario) to watch sunset over the beautiful Lake Titicaca.  By this point, we were used to the high elevation in this region of the world.  We decided to not do the boat tour out to Isla Del Sol due to our schedule and general tiredness of amazing beaches.

The next day, we took the bus to the old capital of Bolivia: La Paz.  At almost 12,000 feet in elevation, this city used to be the highest elevation capital in the world.  La Paz is still the administrative capital and most would call it the “de facto” capital, even though Sucre is now officially recognized as the capital.  This city is so high in elevation that several soccer teams banned their stadium saying that it was too unfair for the locals training at high elevation versus the away teams.


We did some awesome tours in La Paz.  Firstly, their new cable car system was finished in 2016 and we got to do a full cable car tour of the cities of La Paz and El Alto.  It is truly a revolutionary technology and a great way to travel for those who don’t like the congestion and traffic of ![](bolivia/ElenaRappel_opt.jpg "Rappel")vehicles (especially if/when there are protests going on in the streets).  We also did a terrific walking tour of the city and learned a lot about the country’s past, present, and hopeful future.  We were blown away by the kindness and general likeability of the Bolivian people in this city.  We even got to rappel 50 meters from the top of a skyscraper wearing costumes in La Paz.  What a funky, unique experience!  It is no wonder that La Paz is considered one of the “7 Wonder Cities of the World.”

![](bolivia/LukeBike_opt.jpg "Death Road") Getting out of the city around La Paz was also very nice.  They have a famous bike route called “Death Road” which is basically a chance to bike down a hill alongside a cliff for miles and miles.  It is the only road in Bolivia where the cars drive on opposite sides of the road to make sure that the driver doesn’t accidentally go too far.  While parts of the road are a bit nerve wracking, it really is not as scary as it sounds.  You can hug the wall side of the cliff the whole time.  It is really just a fun experience to get outside and get some exercise at high elevation.  

We also got lucky while we were in Bolivia in that it was Carnival season.   You may have heard of the large carnival held in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.  That is known to be the biggest Carnival in the world at about 2 million people per day. ![](bolivia/carnaval_opt.jpg "Oruro Carnaval")While the carnival in Bolivia isn’t as big as that, it still is sizable at about 400,000 people.  Some even say it is the oldest carnival in Latin America.  Regardless, most would say it is a top 3 carnival in the world.  For us, it was incredible!  The people, the colors, the dedication to costumes were all amazing.

The carnival in Oruro is the largest annual event in Bolivia.  ![](bolivia/trainLuke_opt.jpg "Train Graveyard")And it is definitely a must-see if you are in Bolivia during carnival season.  The festival itself is basically a 20 hour long parade which tells a story: the Diablada.  That story is that good will triumph over evil.  With elaborate costumes and immaculate makeup, the tens of thousands of people that we saw walking through the parade that day was impressive, to say the least.

During and after carnival, it is also common to spray people with a pressurized water and soap combination in a spray can of foam called estufa.  This was a very fun tradition and you could see that almost everyone was getting in on the action.  It was basically a city wide squirt gun fight.  We definitely need to adopt a tradition like that in the United States.![](bolivia/redRockLuke_opt.jpg "Red Rocks")

There were a lot of other things that I would have loved to do in Bolivia such as go into the Amazon jungle, explore some of their National Parks, or see some of their other cities.  But we were on a bit of a time constraint, so we opted to take a night bus down to Uyuni to start our 3 day tour of the salt flats (Salar de Uyuni).

Hands down, the most popular and famous tourist attraction in Bolivia is the salt flats.  No question.  They are the largest salt flats in the world and produce endless amazing pictures due to the eery endlessness.  This lack of depth perception makes the salt flats the perfect place for funny pictures of people in a bowl of soup, or a person tightrope walking across a shoelace.![](bolivia/sunsetLuke_opt.jpg "Uyuni Salt Flats")

We were also lucky in that it was the rainy season in Bolivia.  So, this meant that there was 1-2 inches of water everywhere on the flats.  This helps with getting cool reflective pictures, like a shallow pond reflecting the light.

We also got to see weird things such as a hotel made out of salt bricks and salt tables and chairs.  While the salt flats were cool, there were also other parts of the 3 day tour that were amazing such as extremely dry rocky areas that looked like you were on Mars.  There were hot springs, geysers, mountains, red lagoons, blue lagoons, green lagoons, and even desert flamingos.  

The three day tour from Uyuni was definitely a cool and unique experience.  And it was a great way to make it to the border of our next country of Chile! ![](bolivia/lagoonElena_opt.jpg "Red Lagoon")
