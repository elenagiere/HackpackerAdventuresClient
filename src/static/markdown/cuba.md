Cuba definitely has to be near the top of the list for the combination of the most difficult to plan places while also being one of the most rewarding places to visit.  For those who don’t know, the United States requires you to fit one of 12 reasons in order to visit Cuba.  Unfortunately, Elena and I missed the June 2019 deadline when President Donald Trump removed the 13th (and easiest) reason for visiting which was “people to people.”  This means that as of June 2019, cruise ships from Florida could no longer dock in Havana’s harbor.  It also means that simply taking walking tours, sightseeing, chatting with locals, and general tourism was no longer officially accepted as a reason to be able to visit.  Instead, we decided to file our trip under “support of the Cuban ![](cuba/havanaStreetsDay_opt.jpg "Havana, Cuba") people.”  Therefore, we supported capitalistic ideals in the forms of trying to help entrepreneurs with starting businesses and growing their businesses in a mix of an otherwise somewhat Communist somewhat Capitalist country.

In addition to declaring our “support of the Cuban people,” we were also warned that we may need to show an itinerary of our plans during our trip in Cuba.  Thankfully, this was not too uncommon for Elena and I as we have created many itineraries for past trips to stay organized and maximize our vacation days.  Also, we were told that there wouldn’t always be good Wi-Fi signal which was yet another reason to be relatively prepared before entering Cuba - such as downloading offline maps, taking screenshots of addresses and directions, etc.  Lastly, there are very few ATMs in the country and none work for US banks.  So, unless you have a debit card from a European bank, you need to be old school and bring cold hard cash.  Since we were coming from Mexico, we brought Mexican Pesos with us to avoid the terrible exchange rate of US dollars.

All of that preparation only helped us to have a better time once we got there.  We had a good grasp of our budget.  We had a good idea of our itinerary and our constraints.  And we were ready to explore the music, culture, landscape and history of Cuba!

Right away, we got thrown into the Cuban culture.  We took a collectivo (shared taxi) from the ![](cuba/havanaStreets_opt.jpg "Havana, Cuba") Havana airport into the historic city center.  However, this was nothing like a collectivo in Mexico.  No, this was a car from 1955 and a “new” motor from 1988.  That’s right, a car almost 65 years old with a motor that has seen a few decades of sputtering around as well.  Needless to say, the driver laughed at us when we went to reach for our seatbelts.  The seatbelts were longggg gone.  Even though I thought we could have exploded into a ball of flames at any moment, we eventually made it to the historic downtown of Havana in one piece.  And I’m glad we did.  The city was beautiful. Much like Latin America, Cuban architecture has a lot of color.  Colorful houses and buildings decorated the cobblestone streets.  After checking into our Airbnb, we strolled around the streets listening to the salsa, Afro-cuban jazz, and timba that you could hear on almost every corner.  Rooftop bars and restaurants served mojitos and cuba libres late into the night.  We ended up finding solace in a rooftop restaurant serving lobster paella and mojitos.  This was a nice change from our 130 tacos each from our October travels in Mexico.

The next day, we took a bus to Viñales, an area of the country known for its tobacco farms where much of the world’s best cigars come from.  There was a slight mix up with the booking of our Airbnb.  I thought I booked something in the downtown area of Viñales.  But in actuality, I booked something about a 40 minute drive from the city centre.  Oops!  Sorry Elena!  Thankfully, it ended up working out quite well.  It was a beautiful area out in the mountains where we were the only ![](cuba/vinalesRain_opt.jpg "Vinales, Cuba") tourists in the whole town.  And the best part is that our $11/night Airbnb apparently included a chauffeur from Viñales to the house as well as whenever we needed it for various tours.  Our host even took us to a tobacco farm to smoke a free puro cigar and get a tour of the harvesting, drying and cigar rolling process.  And driving through the countryside in another 1950s bright red car with our chauffeur was actually amazing to see him wave to almost every neighbor like the popular guy he is.  So, it wasn’t too bad of a deal after all! ;)

According to several Cubans we talked to, you can’t say that you’ve experienced Cuban culture without doing three things: dancing salsa, smoking a puro, and drinking rum.  These are the three essentials in Cuban culture.  While our hosts didn’t smoke or drink, they helped us find the best deals with getting good rum.  They even cooked dinner for us and let us bombard them with questions about their culture, history and extreme love of Fidel Castro.

The next day, we did a tour of Viñales with our chauffeur and got to see museums, murals, sights of the valley, cave tours, and places that African slaves would hide back in the day when the country was ruled by Spain. ![](cuba/indioCave_opt.jpg "Indio Cave") We also took a horseback tour to a natural lake within one of the country’s national parks.  There we tried one of the only locations in the world where they make “guava rum.”  While an interesting and very unique taste, it wasn’t something I need to taste again.

The next day, we spent going to Cayo Jutías - a nice beach on the north side of the country near Viñales.  Even though the site is near, the roads out here were terrible.  The driver has to be on his A game out here when it is pothole after pothole for miles on end sometimes.  Perhaps that is why they have a minimum age of 19 to receive a driver’s license.  Or perhaps it is because horses and horse drawn carriages can ride on the main highway right alongside semi trucks and 18 wheelers. ![](cuba/cayojutias_opt.jpg "Cayo Jutias, Cuba") 

Eventually, we had to head back to Havana and explore a bit more of the history and culture of this great country’s capital city.  Packed with museums, tourists, and walking tours, there were ample ways to explore Cuban culture and history here.  We decided to grab some $1 personal pan pizzas, some local beer, and walk around the town exploring the rich culture here. The highlight of the day was a 2 hour walking tour with a political science professor who enriched us with so much Cuban history and culture in addition to her opinions about her own country.

Despite the strange hours of stores and lack of grocery stores open at convenient hours, Havana was an incredibly fun city to explore for a few days.  It took some work to get to Cuba and to figure out our plans within the country.  But once we were here, we had an amazing time talking with locals and learning about this country’s unique history.  We highly recommend visiting here if you get the chance.  But now, we’re heading back to the Yucatan Peninsula and getting ready to enter Belize and other countries in southern Central America.

#### Money Saving Tips Used This Trip:

* If your trip is relatively planned out, then book your casa particular accommodation via Airbnb.  They are very cheap.  For us, it cost around $10-$15 USD per night for an air-conditioned bedroom with private bathroom.  This will save you from having to bring extra cash with you for accommodation expenses.
* Fly to Cuba through Mexico (Cancun and Merida both have ample flights there).  Your Cuban tourist visa will be green instead of pink and will be much cheaper.  Flights are sometimes cheaper as well.
* Bring Mexican Pesos, Euros or another currency other than US dollars.  US dollars get hit with an extra 10% fee when exchanging US dollars to Cuban Convertible Peso (CUC).
* Try your best to plan the exact amount of money you’ll need.  If you don’t have enough money at the end of your trip, you may go hungry for a few days.  If you have too much Cuban money at the end of your trip, the money exchange offices will not always have the currency you want to exchange back to.  For us, we were stuck with about the equivalent of $16 USD that we had to spend at the airport.  We could have been in a much worse situation if we didn’t budget appropriately or re-evaluate towards the end of our trip.
